# Summary
This is a repo containing my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

This year I will use the challenges as an opportunity to learn `Rust`!

## Repo structure
* Each day challenge has its own subfolder `src/day1`, `src/day2`, ... 📅
* Inside each day folder is a `mod.rs` file which imports two modules, `solve_1.rs` and `solve_2.rs` which corresponds to this day's questions (one file per question). ❓
* The main function `src/main.rs` will import all those modules
* To run the function corresponding to the day `n`, you just need to run `cargo run -- run n` 💥
* To start a challenge for a new day, you can help with `cargo run -- add n` where Rust will create a new subfolder, copy template files into this subfolder. 😅
